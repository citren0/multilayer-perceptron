# multilayer-perceptron
## What is this?
This repository contains the C++ code for a multi-layer perceptron neural network. Training data is contained within TrainingData.cpp. The main code will run back propagation to train the network with a specified number of epochs. Then, inference will be run on the weights and biases computed via gradient descent.

## How to run it?
```
$ make
$ ./a.out
```
